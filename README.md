# Spam-mail
Classification problems can be broadly split into two categories: binary classification problems, and multi-class classification problems. Binary classification means there are only two possible label classes, e.g. a patient’s condition is cancerous or it isn’t, or a financial transaction is fraudulent or it is not. Multi-class classification refers to cases where there are more than two label classes. An example of this is classifying the sentiment of a movie review into positive, negative, or neutral.

There are many types of NLP problems, and one of the most common types is the classification of strings. Examples of this include the classification of movies/news articles into different genres and the automated classification of emails into a spam or not spam. I’ll be looking into this last example in more detail for this article.

Problem Description
Understanding the problem is a crucial first step in solving any machine learning problem. In this article, we will explore and understand the process of classifying emails as spam or not spam. This is called Spam Detection, and it is a binary classification problem.

The reason to do this is simple: by detecting unsolicited and unwanted emails, we can prevent spam messages from creeping into the user’s inbox, thereby improving user experience.
